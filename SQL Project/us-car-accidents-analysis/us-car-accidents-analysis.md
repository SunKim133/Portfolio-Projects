# U.S. Traffic Accidents Analysis (2017-2022)

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of U.S. traffic accidents from 2017 to 2022. The main tools utilized for this project are SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization.

## Overview

The dataset comprises various attributes related to traffic accidents, including time, location, and specific traffic features. The project primarily focuses on temporal and geographic analysis.

## Key Features

- **Temporal Analysis**: This analysis gives insights into the variation of accidents over different times of the day, days of the week, months, and years.
  
- **Geographic Analysis**: Utilizing Tableau's advanced visualization features, the project offers a dynamic dashboard that displays accident data on a map, allowing for filtering by state and city. 

- **Traffic Features and Conditions**: Explored the impact of various traffic features and conditions on accident rates. 

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: Used for data preprocessing, filtering, structuring, and temporal & geographic analyses.
  
- **Tableau**: Leveraged for creating interactive and insightful dashboards that highlight accident distributions across regions and times.

## Visualizations

- **Drill Down Map**: Showcases analysis on multiple levels such as State, County, and City.
  
- **Time-based Charts**: Highlights accident counts by different time granularities, providing insights into peak and low times.

## Insights

The analyses provided valuable insights into:
- Peak accident times and months.
- Regions with higher accident rates.
- The impact of various traffic features on accident rates.

## Setup & Usage
